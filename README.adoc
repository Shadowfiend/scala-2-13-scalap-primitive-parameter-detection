= `scalap` 2.13.[0|1] issue with constructor parameters

This repo demonstrates an issue with scalap in Scala 2.13.0 and 2.13.1 whereby
it does not report constructor parameters in the same way as Scala <2.12.

To show this, run the following two commands:

```
$ sbt "++2.12.9 run"

[info] Loading settings for project scala-2-13-scalap-primitive-parameter-detection from build.sbt ...

```

In 2.12.9, the `MethodSignature` object for the constructor has one entry for
`children`, the single constructor parameter. In 2.13.1, the object has no
`children` at all, making it impossible to explore the constructor's
parameters.

== Context

This was discovered while trying to make the tests for
[`lift-json`](https://github.com/lift/framework/tree/master/core/json) run
successfully for Scala 2.13.
